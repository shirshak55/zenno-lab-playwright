-   Common Captcha like aliexpress annoying captcha? Jeez just let me browse products but no they think I am bot and should fill captcha every 2secs. It sucks.

##### Is it Ethical?

-   You decide.
<!-- -   You decide whether website should feed gaints like google?
-   You decide if its ethical for ads company to hoard all the data so that they can do machine learning?
-   You decide if ads company like google use data for machine learning?
-   You decide whether some pro minds buys all the tickets and you are left with no choice other than buying tickets in black? Or use technology like this?
-   May be such projects help website owner to realize captcha is not the solution? -->
-   Ethics is hard.
